# üêç Python & HTML Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python and HTML projects demonstrating concepts like **Django signals**, **Python iterators**, and interactive web visualization.

---

## üì¶ Projects Included

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Django Signals ‚Äì Basic Example (`Question_1.py`)

Demonstrates how Django signals work synchronously.

* Defines a custom signal.
* Connects a receiver using the `@receiver` decorator.
* Prints output before and after sending the signal.

**Run:**

```bash
python Question_1.py
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Django Signals with Thread Info (`Question_2.py`)

Extends the previous example to show the thread context of Django signals.

* Prints current thread name while sending and receiving signals.
* Confirms that signals run in the same thread as the sender by default.

**Run:**

```bash
python Question_2.py
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Django Signals with Database Transactions (`Question_3.py`)

Demonstrates Django signals executed inside a database transaction.

* Uses `transaction.atomic()` to simulate a DB operation.
* Shows that signal handlers execute within the transaction scope.

**Run:**

```bash
python Question_3.py
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Interactive Rectangle Visualization (`Rectangle.html`)

An interactive HTML demo visualizing a **Python Rectangle class** using the iterator protocol.

* Enter rectangle dimensions to visualize it dynamically.
* Highlights Python‚Äôs `__iter__` and `__next__` methods.
* Built with TailwindCSS for modern design.

**Open in Browser:**
Double-click `Rectangle.html` or open with any web browser.
